        <p class="about_para">First Creation of Champarn District : 1866 On 2nd November 1972 Champaran district was
            split up Into two districts, viz. Purbi Champaran and Paschim Champaran. East Champaran is a part of Tirhut
            Division. The headquarter of Purbi Champaran district is at Motihari .Presently Purbi Champaran consists of
            Six Subdivisions and Twenty Seven Blocks. Nepal makes its northern boundary, Sitamadhi and Sheohar eastern
            while Muzaffarpur South and with part of Gopalganj bounds it in western side. The name Champaran owes its
            origin to Champa-aranya or Champkatanys. Champa or Champaka means Magnolia and aranya mess forest. Hence,
            Champaranya means Forest of Magnolia (CHAMPA) trees. It is popularly believed that the nomenclature here was
            made while the vest forest part was inhabited by solitary ascetics. It is needless to say that has Purbi
            means Eastern Side.

        <p class="history_para">From epic time till today, the history of Champaran has been glorious and important. It
            is mentioned in the Purana that the devotee Dhruv, son of King Uttanapada, here had done terrible penance
            for attaining knowledge at the place called Tapovan. On the one hand, the land of Champaran is sacred due to
            the Goddess of Sita, on the other hand, the Satyagraha of Gandhiji in modern India is an invaluable page in
            the history of Indian independence. At the time of King Janak, this was part of the Tirahut kingdom. People
            believe that Jankigharh, also known as Chanchigarh, was the capital of King Janakâ€™s Veeveda state. Which
            later became part of the Vaishali empire in the 6th century BC. Lord Buddha had given his sermons here, in
            memory of which in the 3rd century BC, Priyadarshi Ashok made pillars and constructed stupas. After the
            decline of the Gupta Dynasty and the Pala Dynasty, the entire Champaran region, including Mithila, became
            subject to the Karnat dynasty. Local satraps were directly ruled by Muslims until and after this. Mahatma
            Gandhi came to Motihari in April 1917 on the call of Prince Shukla, a rayat of freedom and freedom fighter
            of India during the freedom struggle, and successfully used the first successful experiment of Satyagraha in
            protest of the three acrimonious cultivation of the Nil crop. This was the beginning of the new phase in the
            fight for independence. Later, Bapu came here many times. The British had made Champaran an independent unit
            in 1866, but in 1971 it was divided into Eastern and Western Champaran</p>
